Car Spotter Privacy Policy
Effective date: 2026-01-20

Car Spotter analyzes vehicle listing pages on Facebook Marketplace and provides an on-page
overlay with extracted listing details and AI-generated insights. This policy explains what
data is handled and how it is used.

Data We Process
- Website content from the listing page (title, price, mileage, description, specs).
- The listing URL (to associate the analysis with the current page).
- Network metadata (e.g., IP address) may be processed by our backend hosting provider for security and rate limiting.

How We Use Data
- To generate vehicle analysis and insights for the current listing.
- To improve reliability (basic rate limiting and caching).

Data Sharing
Listing data is sent to our backend service to generate analysis. We do not sell user data.

Data Retention
Analysis responses may be cached briefly to reduce repeated requests. We do not store user
accounts or personal identifiers.

Your Choices
You can disable or uninstall the extension at any time. The extension runs only on Facebook
Marketplace item pages.
